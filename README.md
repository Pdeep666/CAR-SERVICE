# CAR-SERVICE
WEBSITE
IMPORTANT NOTE:-

WE HAVE CREATED THE  PROJECT TARS CARS SUCCESSFULLY USING  HTML, CSS, JS (FRONTEND) AND DJANGO, SQLLITE(BACKEND)

IN THIS PROJECT WE HAVE MAINLY 3 SECTIONS
1. SIGN-UP/SIGN-IN PAGE
2. MAIN DASHBOARD
3. REGISTRATION FORM


IT COVERS ALL THE ASPECTS AND SPECIFICATIONS AS A CAR SERVICE WEBSITE NEEDS TO HAVE.

WE HAVE CREATED THIS PROJECT FROM SCRATCH AND ALL THE FRONTEND AND BACKEND CODING IS TOTALLY DONE BY OUR TEAM BRO CODERZ



THE PROJECT IS SUCCESSFULLY RUNNING IN LAPTOP/PC. BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE WERE NOT ABLE TO CREATE LIVE LINK IN GITHUB, BUT WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SUBMITTED OUR PROJECT IN THE REPOSITORY. 
SO PLEASE CONSIDER OUR REQUEST AND EVALUATE OUR PROJECT CORRECTLY,



FOR VIEWING/RUNNING THE PROJECT  FOLLOWING ARE THE STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED:-
1) Make sure Python and Django is installed in your system,
if not, then install python from the official website and   in command prompt or any terminal of text editor, type the following command to install Django-
	$pip install django

2) Open the project in the Text Editor and travel to it's root directory

3) "Type the command $python manage.py runserver to run the localhost server."

 


4) After running the above command, the locahost server will be opened in the browser and the index.html page of the project will be shown, as in below
